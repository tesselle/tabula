## Overview

An easy way to examine archaeological count data. This package provides a convenient and reproducible toolkit for relative and absolute dating and analysis of (chronological) patterns. It includes functions for matrix seriation (reciprocal ranking, CA-based seriation), chronological modeling and dating of archaeological assemblages and/or objects. Beyond these, the package provides several tests and measures of diversity: heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.), richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.), turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.). The package make it easy to visualize count data and statistical thresholds: rank vs. abundance plots, heatmaps, Ford (1962) and Bertin (1977) diagrams.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **tabula** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tabula")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nfrerebeau/tabula")
```

## Usage

```{r packages-load}
# Load packages
library(tabula)

library(khroma)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
```

**tabula** uses a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix. Please refer to the documentation of the [**arkhe**](https://github.com/nfrerebeau/arkhe) package where these classes are defined.

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable (type/taxa) must be saved in its own column and each observation (sample/case) must be saved in its own row.

### Visualization

Several types of graphs are available in **tabula** which uses [**ggplot2**](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) for plotting informations. This makes it easy to customize diagrams (e.g. using themes and scales).

Spot matrix^[Adapted from Dan Gopstein's original [idea](https://dgopstein.github.io/articles/spot-matrix/).] allows direct examination of data:

```{r plot-occ, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
# Plot co-occurrence of types
# (i.e. how many times (percent) each pairs of taxa occur together 
# in at least one sample.)
mississippi %>%
  as_occurrence() %>%
  plot_spot() +
  ggplot2::labs(size = "", colour = "Co-occurrence") +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.box = "horizontal") +
  khroma::scale_colour_YlOrBr()
```

Bertin or Ford (battleship curve) diagrams can be plotted, with statistic threshold (including B. Desachy's [sériographe](https://doi.org/10.3406/pica.2004.2396)). 

```{r bertin, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align="center", fig.show="hold"}
# Bertin matrix with variables scaled to 0-1 and the variable mean as threshold
scale_01 <- function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
mississippi %>%
  as_count() %>%
  plot_bertin(threshold = mean, scale = scale_01) +
  khroma::scale_fill_vibrant()
```

```{r ford, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center", fig.show="hold"}
compiegne %>%
  as_count() %>%
  plot_ford()
```

### Seriation

```{r seriate-incidence}
# Build an incidence matrix with random data
set.seed(12345)
incidence <- IncidenceMatrix(data = sample(0:1, 400, TRUE, c(0.6, 0.4)),
                             nrow = 20)

# Get seriation order on rows and columns
# Correspondance analysis-based seriation
(indices <- seriate_rank(incidence, margin = c(1, 2)))

# Permute matrix rows and columns
incidence2 <- permute(incidence, indices)
```

```{r permute-incidence, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.show="hold"}
# Plot matrix
plot_heatmap(incidence) + 
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Original matrix") +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "black", "FALSE" = "white"))
plot_heatmap(incidence2) + 
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Rearranged matrix") +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "black", "FALSE" = "white"))
```

### Dating

This package provides an implementation of the chronological modeling method developed by Bellanger and Husi ([2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2011.06.031)). This method is slightly modified here and allows the construction of different probability density curves of archaeological assemblage dates (*event*, *activity* and *tempo*). Note that this implementation is experimental (see `help(date_event)`).

```{r date, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.show="hold"}
# Coerce dataset to abundance (count) matrix
zuni_counts <- as_count(zuni)
# Assume that some assemblages are reliably dated (this is NOT a real example)
# The names of the vector entries must match the names of the assemblages
zuni_dates <- c(
  LZ0569 = 1097, LZ0279 = 1119, CS16 = 1328, LZ0066 = 1111,
  LZ0852 = 1216, LZ1209 = 1251, CS144 = 1262, LZ0563 = 1206,
  LZ0329 = 1076, LZ0005Q = 859, LZ0322 = 1109, LZ0067 = 863,
  LZ0578 = 1180, LZ0227 = 1104, LZ0610 = 1074
)

# Model the event date for each assemblage
model <- date_event(zuni_counts, dates = zuni_dates, cutoff = 90)
# Predict event and accumulation dates
event <- predict_event(model, zuni_counts)

# Plot activity and tempo distributions
plot_date(event, type = "activity", select = "LZ1105") +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Activity plot") +
  ggplot2::theme_bw()
plot_date(event, type = "tempo", select = "LZ1105") +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Tempo plot") +
  ggplot2::theme_bw()
```

### Analysis

*Diversity* can be measured according to several indices (referred to as indices of *heterogeneity* -- see `vignette("diversity")`):

```{r diversity}
mississippi %>%
  as_count() %>%
  index_heterogeneity(method = "shannon")

## Test difference in Shannon diversity between assemblages
## (returns a matrix of adjusted p values)
mississippi[1:5, ] %>%
  as_count() %>%
  test_diversity()
```

Corresponding *evenness* (i.e. a measure of how evenly individuals are distributed across the sample) can also be computed, as well as *richness* and *rarefaction*.

```{r sample-size, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
# Data from Conkey 1980, Kintigh 1989, p. 28
altamira %>%
  as_count() %>%
  index_richness(method = "none", simulate = TRUE) %>% 
  plot_diversity()
```

Several methods can be used to ascertain the degree of *turnover* in taxa composition along a gradient on qualitative (presence/absence) data. It assumes that the order of the matrix rows (from *1* to *n*) follows the progression along the gradient/transect.

Diversity can also be measured by addressing *similarity* between pairs of sites:

```{r similarity-brainerd, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
## Calculate the Brainerd-Robinson index
## Plot the similarity matrix
mississippi %>%
  as_count() %>%
  similarity(method = "brainerd") %>%
  plot_spot() +
  ggplot2::labs(size = "Similarity", colour = "Similarity") +
  khroma::scale_colour_iridescent()
```
