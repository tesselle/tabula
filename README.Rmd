## Overview

An easy way to examine archaeological count data. **tabula** provides several tests and measures of diversity: heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.), richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.), turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.). The package make it easy to visualize count data and statistical thresholds: rank vs. abundance plots, heatmaps, @ford1962 and @bertin1977 diagrams.

[**kairos**](https://packages.tesselle.org/kairos/) is a companion package to **tabula** that provides functions for chronological modeling and dating of archaeological assemblages from count data.

**Prior to version 2.0.0, tabula included various matrix seriation methods. These methods have been moved to [kairos](https://packages.tesselle.org/kairos/), so that we no longer have chronological tools in two separate packages.**

```{r citation, echo=FALSE, comment=''}
utils::citation("tabula")
```

## Installation

You can install the released version of **tabula** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tabula")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesselle/tabula")
```

## Usage

```{r packages-load, message=FALSE}
## Install extra packages (if needed)
# install.packages("khroma")

## Load packages
library(folio) # Datasets
library(tabula)
```

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable (type/taxa) must be saved in its own column and each observation (sample/case) must be saved in its own row.

### Visualization

Several types of graphs are available in **tabula** which uses [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) for plotting informations. This makes it easy to customize diagrams (e.g. using themes and scales).

Bertin or Ford (battleship curve) diagrams can be plotted, with statistic threshold (including B. Desachy's [sériographe](https://doi.org/10.3406/pica.2004.2396)). 

```{r bertin, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
## Bertin matrix with variables scaled to 0-1 and the variable mean as threshold
scale_01 <- function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

## Data from Lipo et al. 2015
plot_bertin(mississippi, threshold = mean, scale = scale_01) +
  khroma::scale_fill_vibrant(name = "Mean")
```

```{r ford, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
## Ford diagram
plot_ford(mississippi)
```

Spot matrix allows direct examination of data:

```{r plot-occ, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
## Plot co-occurrence of types
## (i.e. how many times (percent) each pairs of taxa occur together 
## in at least one sample.)
mississippi |> 
  occurrence() |> 
  plot_spot() +
  khroma::scale_colour_YlOrBr()
```

### Diversity

*Diversity* can be measured according to several indices (referred to as indices of *heterogeneity* -- see `vignette("diversity")`). Corresponding *evenness* (i.e. a measure of how evenly individuals are distributed across the sample) can also be computed, as well as *richness* and *rarefaction*.

```{r diversity}
heterogeneity(mississippi, method = "shannon")
```

Measure diversity by comparing to simulated assemblages:

```{r sample-size, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.show="hold"}
set.seed(12345)

## Data from Conkey 1980, Kintigh 1989, p. 28
chevelon |>
  heterogeneity(method = "shannon") |>
  simulate() |>
  plot()

chevelon |>
  richness(method = "count") |>
  simulate() |>
  plot()
```

Several methods can be used to ascertain the degree of *turnover* in taxa composition along a gradient on qualitative (presence/absence) data. It assumes that the order of the matrix rows (from *1* to *n*) follows the progression along the gradient/transect.

Diversity can also be measured by addressing *similarity* between pairs of sites:

```{r similarity-brainerd, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
## Calculate the Brainerd-Robinson index
## Plot the similarity matrix
s <- similarity(mississippi, method = "brainerd")

plot_spot(s) +
  khroma::scale_colour_iridescent(name = "brainerd")
```
